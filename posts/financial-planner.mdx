# Overview

I've always planned my finances in a spreadsheet, which works extremely awesomely (because spreadsheets rule) 
until it doesn't, and it becomes unworkable to update and 'branch' with different options.  I've done lots of
fits and starts and making a software package to do the same and this is the next one.

# What the software should do 
My spreadsheet normally works like this:

First column is a running month/year column, with a row for each month. Each subsequent column has running totals for these months

## Net Worth
A section of columns for net worth.. total net worth, then broken down by (Property, Liquid, Retirement, Debt)

## Income

A section of columns for income, my takehome, my wife's takehome, and other income rolled up

## Spend allocation
A break down of how that takehome gets allocated:

1. A configured 'discretionary' spend - this is basically a lump value for month budget not including 'non-discretionary' spend, i.e. debt servicing, required mortgage payments, etc
2. A total 'non-discretionary' spend - this is the sum of all the non-discretionary spend, which is broken down in other sections

## Surplus allocation  
A breakdown of surplus allocation according to some strategy I have encoded, for example I've had schemes such as:

    - Prioritize paying off my HELOC (variable APR) up to some maximum amount per month, then put everything in taxable brokerage 
    - Prioritize paying into my 529 for 6 months, then back to paying off HELOC, then put everything into taxable brokerage from then on

## Example Scenarios
Here are some scenarios I have used this for
- Simple check in on whether our family budget is going to lead us to our goals
- Consider big financial decisions such as job changes, 429 investments, decide on things like prepaying a mortgage vs investing in a taxable account, how much to put in tax deferred retirement accounts
- Using net worth at target dates along with target retirement dates and target retirement spend to see how things go

## What didn't work well
- Adding new accounts - e.g. what if we bought a second property
- Visibility into where the money was going without reading and holding all formulas in your head
- Debugging errors
- Explaining the results to my wife
- No modeling of taxes, makes that hard to compare
- Inflation sort of washed out, not sure that is valid


# So here's what I want 
A projection system that lets me configured my current accounts, mortgages, investments, etc, then projects network at different times in the future.  I want to be able to make different projections where one is a copy of the other but with some changes, and see the different outcomes easily (graphically)

# User-Facing Conceptual Model

## Accounts

### Income Accounts
- Represents different sources of income

#### Named Monthly Income
- Have a set amount
- Start and stop on different days,
- Have a growth function
    - constant rate 
    - based on a defined time curve (later functionality)

### Spend Accounts
- Represent accounts of spending such as discretionary budgets, mortgages,
current lines of credit 

#### Named Monthly Spend
- Have a set amount
- Start and stop on different days,
- Have a growth function
    - constant rate 
    - based on a defined time curve (later functionality)

### Asset Accounts
- Values contribute positively to Net Worth
- May appreciate or not

### Liability Accounts
- All liability account balances count negative to Net Worth
- Can have a Lien on an Asset

#### Lien
- A lien is an attachment of a liability to an asset that requires the liability
to be paid off when the asset is liquidated

#### Mortgage
- Debt Balance
- Interest Rate 

# Game Loop

## Generate Income 

## Generate Spend

## Allocate Excess Spend
TODO How??
Ideas..

### Idea 1
"SpendAllocationConfig" - list of &#123; account, constraints &#125; in order of priority?

constraints are like MaxAmount, MinAmount, for network

Allocate min amounts first, by order priority, then allocate to accounts in order of list, respecting max amount





# Thoughts

Both asset accounts and liability accounts can be drawable, e.g.
- A HELOC can be drawn on
- A Checking/brokerage account
