# Overview

I've always planned my finances in a spreadsheet, which works extremely awesomely (because spreadsheets rule) 
until it doesn't, and it becomes unworkable to update and 'branch' with different options.  I've done lots of
fits and starts and making a software package to do the same and this is the next one.

# Primary Functionality
My spreadsheet normally works like this:

First column is a running month/year column, with a row for each month. Each subsequent column has running totals for these months

## Net Worth
A section of columns for net worth.. total net worth, then broken down by (Property, Liquid, Retirement, Debt)

## Income

A section of columns for income, my takehome, my wife's takehome, and other income rolled up

## Spend allocation
A break down of how that takehome gets allocated:

1. A configured 'discretionary' spend - this is basically a lump value for month budget not including 'non-discretionary' spend, i.e. debt servicing, required mortgage payments, etc
2. A total 'non-discretionary' spend - this is the sum of all the non-discretionary spend, which is broken down in other sections

## Surplus allocation  
A breakdown of surplus allocation according to some strategy I have encoded, for example I've had schemes such as:

    Prioritize paying off my HELOC (variable APR) up to some maximum amount per month, then put everything in taxable brokerage 
    Prioritize paying into my 529 for 6 months, then back to paying off HELOC, then put everything into taxable brokerage from then on
